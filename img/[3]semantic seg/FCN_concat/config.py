"""Central configuration for FCN semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012.

Semantic segmentation = classify EVERY PIXEL into one of NUM_CLASSES classes.
This project deliberately reuses the FCOS detector's backbone + FPN neck and
swaps only the task: the pyramid is fused into ONE stride-8 map, a small head
predicts 21 class logits per location, and the logits are upsampled 8x back to
input resolution -- the modern equivalent of the original FCN-8s (merge
stride-32/16/8 information, predict, upsample).

Notice everything that is GONE compared to the detection configs: no anchors,
no regression ranges, no center sampling, no NMS / confidence thresholds.
Dense per-pixel classification needs none of that machinery -- the knobs left
are the crop size, the scale-jitter range, and the same two-stage finetune
schedule that drove the YOLO3/FCOS results.

# Index 0 is BACKGROUND -- segmentation must give every pixel a label, so "none
# of the 20 objects" is itself a class (detection never needed this: there,

# Optional extra training data: SBD ("VOC aug") adds ~9k VOC images that only

# Training samples are random CROP_SIZE x CROP_SIZE crops (after random
# rescaling). Must be a multiple of 32 so the stride-32 grid is integer
# (480 / 32 = 15). 480 ~ VOC's max image side (500), the standard seg choice.
# Unlike detection we do NOT squash whole images to a square: the label is
# per-pixel, so cropping loses only context -- never label precision -- while
# resizing to a square would distort every object.

# very different apparent sizes.
SCALE_RANGE = (0.5, 2.0)

# Eval protocol: images are NOT resized. They are padded (right/bottom) to the

# value is IGNORE_INDEX so padded pixels never count. mIoU is thus measured at
