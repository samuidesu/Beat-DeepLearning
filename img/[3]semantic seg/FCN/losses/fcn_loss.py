"""FCN loss: per-pixel cross-entropy. That's it -- ONE term.

Compare the detection losses this repo has built so far:

    YOLO3 : box(MSE-ish) + objectness(BCE/focal) + class(BCE), anchor matching
    FCOS  : class(focal)  + box(GIoU)            + centerness(BCE), range assignment
    FCN   : cross-entropy(logits, mask)                       <- this file

Why so simple? Detection's whole loss complexity came from the ASSIGNMENT
problem: deciding which location/anchor is responsible for which box before
any loss can be computed. In segmentation the label map already IS one target
per prediction -- pixel (i, j)'s 21 logits vs. pixel (i, j)'s class id --
so there is nothing to assign, match, or balance across branches.

nn.CrossEntropyLoss details worth knowing:
  * input:  RAW logits [B, C, H, W] (log-softmax is applied internally --
    numerically stable, same "loss decodes the raw output" contract as the
    detection projects);
  * target: class ids [B, H, W], dtype long;
  * ignore_index=255 makes VOC's void contours AND our pad pixels contribute
    exactly zero loss and zero gradient;
  * reduction="mean" (default) averages over the NON-ignored pixels only.

Class imbalance note: background is ~70% of VOC pixels, yet plain CE works
(no focal loss, unlike FCOS). Detection faced "1 object vs ~10k background
locations" per image; here every image contributes tens of thousands of
labeled FOREGROUND pixels, so gradients never drown. If rare classes lag,
per-class weights in CrossEntropyLoss(weight=...) are the first knob to try.
