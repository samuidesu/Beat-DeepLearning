"""Recurrent encoder: word vectors -> contextual features. The "neck".

    vectors [B, L, D]  --RNN-->  outputs [B, L, H*dirs]  +  final [B, H*dirs]

A recurrent layer walks the document one token at a time, carrying a hidden
state that summarizes everything read so far:

    vanilla RNN   h_t = tanh(W x_t + U h_{t-1} + b)
    GRU           two gates decide how much of h_{t-1} to keep and how much of
                  the new candidate to write
    LSTM          three gates (input/forget/output) around a separate CELL
                  state c_t that flows through the sequence with only
                  element-wise multiply-add on its path

That last point is the whole story of the family. Backpropagating through T
steps multiplies by the recurrent Jacobian T times, so a vanilla RNN's
gradient shrinks (or explodes) geometrically and it effectively cannot learn
dependencies more than ~10 tokens apart. The gated cells give the gradient an
additive highway.

IMDB is where that difference should be impossible to miss. SST-2's median
sentence was 7 tokens -- short enough that the Elman RNN's memory horizon was
never the binding constraint, and the three cells landed within 2 points of
each other. AG News' 44-token documents widened the gap but did not blow it
open, because topic is largely lexical: even a badly-decayed hidden state can
carry "the last few words were about football".

Here the median review is 230 tokens and MAX_LEN is 400. A vanilla RNN with
"last" pooling has to route the evidence in sentence three through ~300
tanh-and-matmul steps before anything reads it. config.CELL picks which cell
runs, everything else stays identical -- see the README for what that costs.

Two mechanics implemented here that are specific to variable-length text:

  PACKING. A padded batch is a rectangle, but the documents inside are not.
  Feeding <pad> into the recurrence would keep updating the hidden state after
  the document ended, so the "final" state would be the state after k padding
  steps -- a different (and wrong) vector for every length.
  pack_padded_sequence reorganizes the batch into the per-timestep groups of
  still-active rows, so cuDNN steps each row exactly `length` times.

  BIDIRECTIONALITY. A forward RNN's representation of token 3 knows nothing
  about token 40. A second layer reading right-to-left fixes that; the two
  directions are concatenated, which is why the head sees 2*H features.
