"""Embedding layer: token ids -> word vectors. This project's "backbone".

    ids [B, L]  --lookup-->  vectors [B, L, D]

An embedding is just a lookup table of shape [vocab_size, D] -- row i holds
the vector for token id i -- so the "forward pass" is indexing, and the
backward pass adds gradient only to the rows that appeared in the batch. That
is exactly why the two-stage protocol transfers from the CNN projects:

    stage 1  freeze()   -> the table is a fixed feature extractor (GloVe),
                           the RNN learns to read it
    stage 2  unfreeze() -> the table finetunes at a much smaller LR, so
                           task-specific nuance can be learned without
                           destroying the general geometry. This matters more
                           on IMDB than on either sibling: GloVe places
                           "dreadful" and "wonderful" close together (they
                           co-occur constantly), and stage 2 is where the
                           table gets to pull them apart

Two details that are easy to get wrong and cost accuracy silently:

  * padding_idx=0 pins the <pad> row to the zero vector AND blocks gradient
    for it, so padding stays inert even after unfreezing.
  * dropout is applied to the LOOKED-UP VECTORS, not to whole words. (Word-
    level dropout -- randomly replacing tokens with <unk> -- is a different,
    also useful, regularizer; this file does the standard element-wise one.)

Note the scale of this layer on IMDB: the vocabulary rows x 100 dims come to
several million parameters, comparable to the BiLSTM encoder above it -- but
trained on a fifth of AG News' documents. Most of the model is a dictionary,
and stage 1 exists precisely so that dictionary is not being rewritten by
gradients before the encoder knows how to read it.
