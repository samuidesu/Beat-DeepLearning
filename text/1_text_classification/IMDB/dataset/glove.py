"""GloVe word vectors: download + build the pretrained embedding matrix.

GloVe is this project's ImageNet checkpoint. The CNN projects loaded a
backbone trained to recognize objects; here we load a 400k-word table trained
(by counting co-occurrences over 6 billion tokens of Wikipedia + Gigaword) to
place related words near each other. Either way the pattern is the same: start
from general knowledge learned on a huge corpus, then finetune on the small
task-specific dataset.

Why it matters on IMDB specifically: there are only 22,500 training reviews
-- a fifth of AG News -- but they are written in open-ended natural language
by tens of thousands of different people, so the vocabulary is large AND the
data per word is small. GloVe already knows that "dreadful" sits near
"awful", so a review using a word this corpus saw six times is not a lost
cause.

Note how the reason differs across the three text projects: on SST-2 GloVe
mattered because the CORPUS was tiny; on AG News because the VOCABULARY was
huge; here because the ratio between them is the worst of the three.

The file format is plain text, one word per line:
    the 0.418 0.24968 -0.41242 ...      (1 + 100 whitespace-separated fields)

Only the words in OUR vocabulary are kept: 400k x 100 floats would be 160 MB
of embedding table for a model that can only ever look up a fraction of them.

The file is SHARED with the sibling SST-2 and AG-News projects --
config.GLOVE_PATH scans for an existing copy before falling back to our own
data dir -- so this download normally does not run at all.
