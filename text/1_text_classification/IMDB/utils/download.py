"""Resumable multi-connection downloader (shared by the SST-2 and GloVe fetch).

Ported from the segmentation projects' dataset/voc.py, where it existed for
one reason: the hosts we depend on throttle PER CONNECTION, so from a far-away
network a single stream crawls and a 862 MB GloVe archive takes hours. Opening
N parallel HTTP byte-range requests multiplies the throughput by roughly N,
and because each segment is written with append mode, a dropped connection (or
a Ctrl-C) costs only the bytes still missing -- rerunning resumes.

Kept in utils/ rather than dataset/ because TWO different downloads use it
here (the corpus and the word vectors), unlike the CNN projects where the one
copy lived next to the one dataset. Copied from the AG-News project; the only
change is that extract_tar now takes a member filter, because IMDB's tgz
holds twice as many files as this project needs.
