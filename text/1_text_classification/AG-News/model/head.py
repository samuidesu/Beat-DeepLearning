"""Classification head: token features -> one document vector -> 4 logits.

    outputs [B, L, F] (+ final [B, F])  --pool-->  [B, F]  --linear-->  [B, 4]

The segmentation heads had to UPSAMPLE back to per-pixel predictions; a
document classifier does the opposite -- it must COLLAPSE a variable number of
token features into one fixed vector. Three ways to do it, selectable via
config.POOLING:

    "last"  the encoder's document vector: forward end + backward end for
            RNNs, or the last real-token feature for the Transformer.
    "max"   element-wise max over time. Each feature dimension reports its
            strongest activation anywhere in the document, which suits topic
            classification: one decisive word ("midfielder", "Nasdaq") should
            be able to carry the prediction regardless of position.
    "mean"  masked average over time -- smoother, but a long document can
            dilute the one phrase that mattered.

MASKING is the part that must be right. Padded positions are not data: for
"max" they are set to -inf before the reduction (a plain max would happily
return a padding activation whenever it is the largest), and for "mean" the
sum is divided by the TRUE length, not by L. Get this wrong and accuracy
quietly drops with batch composition -- the same document scores differently
depending on which others shared its batch.

WHY 4 LOGITS AND NOT 3: with C mutually exclusive classes, softmax over C
logits is over-parameterized by exactly one direction (adding a constant to
every logit changes nothing), so C-1 outputs would suffice. Nobody does that,
because the symmetric form keeps every class's weight vector interpretable,
lets nn.CrossEntropyLoss take the argmax directly, and costs one extra row of
a linear layer. Same reasoning as the binary case in the SST-2 project, where
2 logits were used instead of 1 sigmoid.
