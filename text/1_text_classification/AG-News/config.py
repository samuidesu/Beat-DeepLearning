"""Central configuration for RNN and Transformer topic classification on AG News.

SECOND TEXT PROJECT of this repo. Everything structural is inherited from the
SST-2 sibling -- same embedding/encoder/head split, same two-stage layered-LR
finetune, same per-epoch JSON log + curve plots. What changes is the TASK, and
the four differences below are the whole point of running a second dataset:

    SST-2                            AG News
    ------------------------------   ---------------------------------------
    2 classes (sentiment)            4 classes (topic: World/Sports/Biz/Tech)
    67k fragments, ~10 tokens each   120k news items, ~46 tokens each
    44/56 class balance              exactly 25/25/25/25
    dev is the reported number       test IS public and labeled

The last row has a methodological consequence. SST-2's test labels are
withheld, so "pick the best epoch on dev" and "report dev" were the same thing
and no leakage was possible. AG News hands you a labeled test set -- which
means selecting checkpoints on it would be scoring your own homework. So this
project carves a VALIDATION split out of train (VAL_RATIO below, stratified +
seeded) for per-epoch monitoring and best-checkpoint selection, and touches
test.csv exactly once, at the end, for the number that goes in the README.

The recurrent cell is selectable (config.CELL or train.py --cell):

    "rnn"  -- vanilla Elman RNN: h_t = tanh(W x_t + U h_{t-1})
    "lstm" -- long short-term memory (input/forget/output gates + cell state)
    "gru"  -- gated recurrent unit (2 gates, no separate cell state)

Each cell writes to its OWN output folder, so the three experiments never
overwrite each other and the comparison is single-variable. Documents here are
~4x longer than SST-2's fragments, which is exactly the regime where the gated
cells are supposed to pull away from the Elman RNN -- see the README.
